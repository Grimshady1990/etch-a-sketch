# Etch-a-Sketch 🎨

Welcome to my version of the classic **Etch-a-Sketch**, built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum!

## 🖌️ What is it?

This is a fun little web app that lets you draw by simply moving your mouse over a grid—just like the old-school Etch-a-Sketch toy, but with a modern, colorful twist.

## ✨ Features

* A clean and responsive grid-based drawing area
* Choose your desired pixel density (i.e., grid size)
* Draw by hovering your mouse—each square lights up with a random color
* No limits: doodle as much as you want!

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the web page.
2. Choose how many squares you want per side (e.g., 16x16, 32x32).
3. Move your mouse over the grid to draw—each square will light up with a new color.
4. Refresh the page or choose a new size to start over.

## 🛠️ Built With

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, event listeners, and user interaction in a fun, hands-on way.

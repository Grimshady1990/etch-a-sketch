# Introduction

This program is a web version of the classic etch-a-sketch that uses mouse over to draw by changing the colors of squares in a grid.

# Plan

For this to work it needs to achieve the following:

- A button that accepts a value between 1-100

- A function that takes that value and returns the square of that value

- A function that takes the square and uses it to create the same number of cells as the value of square.

- The cells need to be styled with flex so they fit the container and shrink and grow depending on the amount that have been created (The container must remain the same size).

- The cells must change color when the mouse hovers over them giving the illusion of drawing.

- The cells color must randomize with each hover.

- the cells opacity must increase by 10% every time the mouse hovers over a cell reaching full color after 10 hovers
